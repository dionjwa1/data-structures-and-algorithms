## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
all events were O(n3) due to the inner loops running in each block of code. Space remained the same. Unless the conditional elese was triggered, which would expand both space and the var by 1 each making it O2(n3)

## Solution
Solution was to walk each array through the PC and document the output.
